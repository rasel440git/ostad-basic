1.	What is the Feasibility Study of the SDLC model & why is this important?

Ans: A feasibility study is the initial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle that
 evaluates the viability of a project. It determines whether the proposed project is
 technically, economically, and legally feasible. 

It is important because it helps to identify potential problems and risks early in the 
development process, reducing the chances of project failure and saving time and resources. 




 
2.	Write 5 advantages of Agile methodology?

Ans:
1.	Agile methodology allows for changes and adaptations throughout the development
    process, making it easier to respond to shifting requirements and priorities.
2.	Agile methodology emphasizes delivering working software quickly, enabling 
    organizations to bring products to market faster.							
3.	Agile methodology encourages close collaboration between development teams, 
    stakeholders, and customers.											
4.	Agile methodology helps ensure that the final product is of high quality and meets
     customer requirements.												
5.	Agile methodology puts the customer at the center of the development process, 
    leading to increased customer engagement and satisfaction with the end product.



 
3.	Write short notes on SDLC model phase.

Ans: short notes on SDLC model phase are below: -

Planning: The planning phase involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives,
     as well as identifying the resources and timelines needed to complete the project.

Analysis: In this phase, the requirements for the project are gathered, analyzed, 
    and documented. This information is used to create a detailed project plan.

Design: The design phase involves creating a detailed design of the system, 
    including technical specifications and architecture.

Development: In this phase, the actual software is developed based on the design 
    specifications.

Testing: The testing phase involves verifying that the software meets the specified 
    requirements and identifying and fixing any defects.

Deployment: In this phase, the software is deployed into a production environment and made available 
    to end-users.

Maintenance: The maintenance phase involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software 
    to ensure its continued operation and performance.
